# Programming Portfolio: Week 1

This folder contains *suggested solutions* to the programming exercises for this week. There are always many ways
to solve a problem, so many other correct solutions exist. There may well be others in the folders for individual
labs.

* `hello.py` is the canonical first program.
* `hello_again.py` is the same, with a slightly different message.
* `hot_july.py` does some simple calculation based on the recent warm weather.
* `boycott.py` displays the remarkable batting average of the Greatest Living Yorkshireman.
* `lab_divider.py` illustrates dividing students between PC labs.

These programs are limited to using the programming ideas included
so far in the lectures and practicals, so in many cases more elegant
or maintainable solutions also exist.

The code is provided "as is", with no warranty, implied or otherwise.

## Advanced Corner

An elegant solution to the last program would simply determine how many
labs are needed, which is not possible with the Python covered to date.
This is fixed in `zz_lab_counter.py`.

Check the use here of a function, f-strings, and conditionals (including
one in-line.)
